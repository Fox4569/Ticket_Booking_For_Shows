# Ticket_Booking_For_Shows
Distributed ticket booking system for shows.
The system consists of two types of components:
                                                - Client, application through which users interact with the system;
                                                - Server, application responsible for all business logic. 
                                                
For management purposes and data persistence, a server uses an SQLite database. The system developed is composed of several servers that interact with each other to guarantee the availability of the service offered through redundancy mechanisms, replication of data and load distribution.
